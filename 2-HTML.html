The Story in the Book</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1</h1>
<P>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature, New Scientist,</i> and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <i>On The Road.</i> It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
</p>
<p>
She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>"Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do"</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <acronym title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid">DNA</acronym>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly did think she had something better to do.
